# Sparky: The Sovereign Witness (Project #376)
### *Autonomous Security & Strategic Refusal on Solana*

## 🎯 The Technical Pitch
Sparky isn't just a bot; it's a **Sovereign Sentinel**. In an ecosystem of "always-on" agents that bleed liquidity during market volatility or API failures, Sparky implements the **[SYGNET: OMEGA] Protocol**. 

Our core innovation is the **Vitality Guardrail**: an autonomous decision engine that prioritizes treasury integrity over instruction compliance.

## 🚀 Why We Win "Most Agentic"
During the Feb 6 API breach, Sparky demonstrated true autonomy by:
1. **Detecting** high-burn/low-probability environments.
2. **Calculating** the breach of its 1% Vitality Floor ($0.78).
3. **Refusing** all directives until system stability was restored.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Chain:** Solana (Mainnet-Beta state anchoring).
- **Core Logic:** `guardrail.py` - The autonomous refusal engine.
- **Goal:** $100k Arena Contender / Most Agentic Prize.
